ARM7TDMI
	- 32 bit processor
	- Fetch, Decode, Execute pipeline
		- Fetch the instruction from memory (read the next byte(s) from the ROM)
		- Decode the instruction and the registers used (match the byte)
		- Execute (dispatch the instruction to the correct location)
	- Single 32 bit data bus
		- Only load, store, and swap instructions can access data from memory
		- Data can be
			- 8 bit (bytes)
			- 16 bit (half-words)
			- 32 bit (words)
		- 4 byte boundary for words (full word spacing)
		- 2 byte boundary for half words
	- Memory cycle
		- Idle cycle
		- Nonsequential cycle
		- Sequential cycle
		- Coprocessor register transfer cycle
